# BookSolutionsAndRandomProjects2012
A collection of solutions to textbook exercises and random projects worked on in 2012-2013. Execute the Jar file to navigate all solutions and projects through the Java Swing GUI.


This is the complete solutions manual for chapters 9 through 14 of the text book I used in my introduction to programming 2 class.
All problems are solved in Java and presented in a GUI interface designed using Java Swing.
In addition to the problem solutions I worked on a few side projects during the class and I added them to the collection.
All problems and side projects can be navigated to from the GUI menus, and you can return to the main page at any time to select a different problem.
Side Projects:
  * Annimated Connect Four game.
  * Line of Sight engine demo. Draw shapes in different colors, and then place light sources in the environment to see the shading effects.
  * Collision Engine. A collision engine with many physics simulations such as orbital mechanics and gravity. Many selectable options
                      for demoing the collision engine.
